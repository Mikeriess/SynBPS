# SynBPS
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/synbps)](https://pepy.tech/project/synbps) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/synbps/badge/?version=latest)](https://synbps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

SynBPS is short for Synthetic Business Process Simulation, as it is intended for the simulation of **synthetic** (i.e. *multiple*, *hypothetical*) business processes from a specified distribution.

## How?
The intended usage of this software is to benchmark new methods within predictive process monitoring research. Rather than calibrating a simulation model from an existing process (as in existing frameworks), the aim is to simulate theoretical processes with varying degrees of noise in duration distributions and entropy in the control-flow. The framework uses customized algorithms, Higher-order Markov Chains (HOMC) and the Hypo-exponential distribution to represent temporal dependency (or its absence) in conditional duration distributions.

## Why?
The benefit of SynBPS is in the full transparency of the data generating process, which can help further understand the influence of process characteristics on predictive performance. By changing the entropy of the process, SynBPS lets you compare the difference in predictive performance across everything between predictable to completely chaotic processes.


# Getting Started
You can install SynBPS using pip:

    pip install SynBPS

SynBPS requires pomegranate 0.14.8 and python 3.9 or higher.

## Example usage
See the [example notebook](https://github.com/Mikeriess/SynBPS/blob/main/tests/test_pypi.ipynb) for a short demo of SynBPS.

## Documentation
See the [official documentation here](https://synbps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Todos
- Extend HOMC to include h > 4 
- Add functionality to specify sampling approach of HOMC
- Add data pre-processing in more formats
